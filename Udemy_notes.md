Node.js is Javascript runtime built on Google v8 engine.

- 'Runtime' means its not a language its use Javascript is a language
- Browser has 'window' but for node it doesn't have 'window', it has 'global'
- Browser has 'document' but node doesn't have.
- Browser have 'process' so that we can directly access the env file in react
- but for node doesn't have process so that we use dotenv to access env file in node
- blocking vs non-blocking
